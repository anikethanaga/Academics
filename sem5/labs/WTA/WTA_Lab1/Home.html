         The earliest records of a place named "Bengaluru" are found in a ninth-century temple in an area now known as "Old Bangalore".
         Legend has it that when the feudal lord Kempe Gowda was once hunting rabbits in the area, a rabbit appeared and attacked his dog. This made a great impression on Gowda and he named the place gandu bhoomi (the place of heroes). In 1537, with the assistance of the local king, he constructed three districts protected by a walled fort on the site.
         During the next three centuries, Bangalore existed very much in the shadow of the neighbouring city, Mysore, and control of the town changed hands many times. The year 1831 marked a major turning point for the city.
